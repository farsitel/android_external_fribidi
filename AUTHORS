behdad: Behdad Esfahbod <behdad@gnu.org>
#
# Behdad Esfahbod is the only one that actually codes these days.  He
# maintains it himself too.  He has revised all code written by anyone else,
# and written much of the code himslef.  He's listed (or at least should be
# listed) on every file in the package as one of the authors.  He designs,
# implements, documents, maintains, all alone... :'-(.
#

dov-g: Dov Grobgeld <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>
#
# Dov Grobgeld originally wrote FriBidi.  The 0.1.* versions are all comletely
# done by Dov.  After that, he almost never touched the code, but contributed
# ideas.  All files that Dov has written originally have him listed as an
# author in the header of the file.
#

#roozbeh: Roozbeh Pournader <roozbeh@gnu.org>
#
# Roozbeh Pournader actually didn't contributed much code to GNU FriBidi; but
# he has promoted and psychologically supported the project.  He has helped
# with making GNU FriBidi standards compliant, and has lobbied with the
# Unicode standard when needed.  He was supposed to become a co-maintainer of
# GNU FriBidi, so applied and got the @gnu.org account, but apparently he's
# not doing that.  He's credited for being a GNU FriBidi author wrongly in
# some communities still.  That's why his name appears in this file, but
# commented out.
#


#
# Note: Other people have contributed significant amounts of code, but the
# code has been faded out by restructuring and redesigning things around GNU
# FriBidi.  As an example, the FriBidiEnv patch by Omer Zak, made itself into
# FriBidi CVS for a couple of years, but finally implemented in a more correct
# way by Behdad Esfahbod.
#
# Note: GNU getopt is distributed with and used in GNU FriBidi under bin/, but
# is not part of GNU FriBidi.
#
# Note: Parts of the Unicode Character Database are distributed with and used
# in GNU FriBidi under gen.tab/unidata/, but are not part of GNU FriBidi.
