Implementation issues:

* Better bootstrap script: steal from GNOME autogen.sh.

* Test ./configure without pkg-config installed.

* Update all files headers/footers.  For c/h files, lib/fribidi-mirroring.[ch]
  is always the reference.

* Show BidiTypes enum in manual.

* Update CapRTL with new Unicode reference code.

* Revise reorder API, in fribidi_main.c reorder after line break.

* Add an option to fribidi_main.c to assume two consecutive returns as
  paragraph separators.

* Design better apis to do reorder based on available levels, remove
  explicit marks then calculate position maps, ....

* Add more tests.  For:
  - Checking that not removing explicit marks in analyze is not changing the
    output in anyway.
  - Tests with BN.  Right now ^ is BN in CapRTL scheme.
  - Test tables.

* Change fribidi-main cmd-line parameters: --mirror --no-mirror...  change the
  defaults too.

* indent:  support function attributes and _PARAMS like things.  Also
  FRIBIDI_BEGIN_DECLS, and LIKELY.

* c2man:  parse Author and Copyright from the whole file.
