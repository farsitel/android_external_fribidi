Implementation issues:

* Better bootstrap script: steal from GNOME autogen.sh.

* Test ./configure without pkg-config installed.

* Update all files headers/footers.  For c/h files, lib/fribidi-mirroring.[ch]
  is always the reference.

* Show BidiTypes enum in manual and gdb.

* Update CapRTL with new Unicode reference code.

* Revise reorder API, in fribidi_main.c reorder after line break.

* Add an option to fribidi_main.c to assume two consecutive returns as
  paragraph separators.

* Design better apis to do reorder based on available levels, remove
  explicit marks then calculate position maps, ....

* Add more tests.  For:
  - Checking that not removing explicit marks in analyze is not changing the
    output in anyway.
  - Tests with BN.  Right now ^ is BN in CapRTL scheme.
  - Test tables.

* Change fribidi-main cmd-line parameters: --mirror --no-mirror...  change the
  defaults too.

* indent:  support function attributes and _PARAMS like things.  Also
  FRIBIDI_BEGIN_DECLS, and LIKELY.

* c2man:  parse Author and Copyright from the whole file.

* Write texinfo documentation.

* Set up gnu.org web pages, and the entry in Free Software Directory.

* Use gengetopt.

* Add FriBidiEnv functionality at compile time.  Also, ifdef out the memory
  cleanup stuff if asked to fail on memory allocation failure (xmalloc).  When
  this is done, FRIBIDI_GNUC_WARN_UNUSEDS can be turned off conditionally.

* Fix cvs2cl bug with spacing around author names read with -U option.  Then
  fix spacing in AUTHORS.

* Use `-' before any command for installing a man page, so that make will
  ignore any errors.

* Clean up README and NEWS, and check all files' headers.  Write
  gen.tab/README.

* Add make rules for lib/$(BUILT_SOURCES) to depend on gen.tab/ stuff.

* When called in interactive mode, fribidi cmd-line should greet, write
  about copyrtight stuff, and shared-libs' version and Unicode version.

* Add Unicode Character Database data structure, to support more than
  one UCD version at the same time.

* Configure gen.tab/ with host=build to avoid cross-compiling table
  generators.

* Replace Arabic Yeh with Persian Yeh in Hafez piece in test/*.

From GNU Coding Standards:

* The distribution should contain a file named `README' which gives the name
  of the package, and a general description of what it does. It is also good
  to explain the purpose of each of the first-level subdirectories in the
  package, if there are any. The `README' file should either state the version
  number of the package, or refer to where in the package it can be found.
