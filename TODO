Implementation issues:

* Test ./configure without pkg-config installed.

* Update all files headers/footers.  For c/h files, lib/fribidi-mirroring.[ch]
  is always the reference.

* Show BidiTypes enum in manual.

* Update CapRTL with new Unicode reference code.

* Revise reorder API, in fribidi_main.c reorder after link break.

* Add an option to fribidi_main.c to assume two consecutive returns as
  paragraph separators.

* Design better apis to do reorder based on available levels, remove
  explicit marks then calculate position maps, ....

* Add more tests.  For:
  - Checking that not removing explicit marks in analyze is not changing the
    output in anyway.
