 *
 * This function finds the base direction of a single paragraph,
 * as defined by rule P2 of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm available at
 * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#P2.
 *
 * You can provide either the string, or the bidi types; or both.
 * If bidi_types are provided, they are used as the bidi types of characters
 * in the string, otherwise the types are computed from the characters in str.
 * Providing bidi types if available at your side, saves you a few cycles.
 * Bidi types can be obtained by calling fribidi_get_bidi_types().
 *
 * You typically do not need this function as
 * fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels() knows how to compute base direction
 * itself, but you may need this to implement a more sophisticated paragraph
 * direction handling.  Note that you can pass more than a paragraph to this
 * function and the direction of the first non-neutral paragraph is returned,
 * which is a very good heuristic to set direction of the neutral paragraphs
 * at the beginning of text.  For other neutral paragraphs, better you use the
 * direction of the previous paragraph.  This is today known as the best
 * auto-paragraph-direction-detection scheme!
 *
 * Returns: Base pargraph direction.  No weak paragraph direction is returned,
 * only LTR, RTL, or ON.

 *
 * Returns: Maximum level found plus one, or zero if any error occured
 * (memory allocation failure most probably).

/* fribidi_reorder_line - reorder a line of logical string to visual
 *
 * This function reorders the characters in a line of text from logical to
 * final visual order.  This function implements part 4 of rule L1, and rules
 * L2 and L3 of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm available at
 * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Reordering_Resolved_Levels.
 *
 * As a side effect it also sets position maps if not NULL.
 *
 * You can provide either the string str, or the bidi types; or both.  If
 * bidi_types are provided, they are used as the bidi types of characters in
 * the string, otherwise the types are computed from the characters in str.
 * If neither str nor bidi types are provided, visual_str is used instead.
 * Feel free to pass the same string as both str and visual_str, but if you
 * done extensive complicated shaping in visual_str, you better provide
 * logical string as str.  There is no known differences yet between providing
 * logical or visual string as str.
 *
 * If you have obtained the embedding levels using custom bidi types, you
 * should provide the same types to this function for valid resutls.
 * Providing bidi types if available at your side, saves you a few cycles, and
 * you don't need to provide str anymore.
 *
 * You should provide the resolved paragraph direction and embedding levels as
 * set by fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels().  Also note that the embedding
 * levels may change a bit.  To be exact, the embedding level of any sequence
 * of white space at the end of line is reset to the paragraph embedding level
 * (That is part 4 of rule L1).
 *
 * Note that the bidi types and embedding levels are not reordered.  You can
 * reorder these (or any other) arrays using the position_L_to_V_map later.
 *
 * Some features of this function can be turned on/off using environmental
 * settings functions fribidi_env_*().
 *
 * Returns: Maximum level found in this line plus one, or zero if any error
 * occured (memory allocation failure most probably).
