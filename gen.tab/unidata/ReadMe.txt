This directory contains the Unicode Character Database
data files.

Currently, the Unicode Character Database files are at
the version level:

   Unicode Standard, Version 4.0.1

For information about the standard itself, see:

http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.1/

Detailed documentation of the files constituting the
Unicode Character Database (contributory data files for
the standard itself) can be found in UCD.html.

Unihan.txt is a very large file. A zipped version is
also provided for downloading convenience: Unihan.zip.

The current Unicode 4.0.1 version of Unihan.txt is also available in
two compressed formats in the Unicode 4.0.1 update directory. See:
http://www.unicode.org/Public/4.0-Update1/
or
ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/4.0-Update1/

Unihan-4.0.1.zip for Windows. (Use winzip)
Unihan-4.0.1.txt.gz  for Unix.    (Use gzip or gunzip)

Note that the files are zipped in
exactly the same format they have on the server (with Unix
line endings). From a browser, right-clicking on 
Unihan.zip will allow automatic download and unzip on a
Windows system with winzip installed.
